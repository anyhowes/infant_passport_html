	  <h1>Nutrition<h1>
	  <h3>Breastfeeding/formula</h3>
	  <p>During the first six months of life, breastfeeding is the only nutrition that should typically be necessary although 
	  it is reccomended that breastfed babies receive vitamin D supplements of 400 IU per day. If, however, you choose commercial 
	  infant formula as an alternative, vitamin D supplementation is not necessary. Exclusive breastfeeding during the first six 
	  months of life is the accepted standard of nutrition as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is an 
	  important part of healthy infant growth and development. Breastmilk provides infants with the correct quality and quantity
	  of nutrients in a form that is easy to digest and absorb. In addition, breastmilk contains critical bio-active agents 
	  including anti-infective immunoglobulins, as well as factors that stimulate the development of the small intestine and aid 
	  in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. </p>
	  <p>Six months of exclusive breastfeeding is sufficient to allow children to 
	  develop to the point where they are ready for nutritionally dense solid foods. Continue to breastfeed as long as the mother
	  is comfortable up until around 9 months of age at which point one can transition to cow's milk as the main milk source. Keep
	  in mind that only 3.25% M.F. should be consumed until 2 years of age when partially skimmed milk can be introduced. Remember
	  that rice or nut beverages should never be used as an infant's main milk source.
